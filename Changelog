1.3
	Changes:
	- Colors on terminals that support it.

	Bugfixes:
	- Compiles on Mac OS X Panther again.
	  (Must not abuse cpp for Makefile magic.)

1.2.1a
	This version only adds some translations.

	Changes:
	- Added Dutch manpage.
	- Added Norwegian translation (+manpage).

1.2.1
	Changes:
	- Improved network version checking code. The game now only
	  complains if version of network code itself differs.
	- Added Italian translation (+manpage).
	- Russian translation (+manpage) added.
	- Added Dutch translation.

1.2
	Bugfixes:
	- "snow deletes the bottom line"-bug fixed. Finally!

	Changes:
	- Added Spanish translation.
	- Added French manpage

1.0.6-pre3
	Changes:
	- Added Portuguese translation.

1.0.6-pre2
	Bugfixes:
	- Fixed wrong hostname in highscore submission code. Actually
	  this has been corrected silently in the 1.0.5 package. :)

	Changes:
	- The game now shows who has quit the game in network mode.
	- Snow does not count as part of the house anymore. Thus if
	  your house is completely gone and only some snow is left
	  you loose from now on. ;)
	- Updated manpages.

1.0.5
	Bugfixes:
	- Fixed buffer overflow in network version checking code. Argh!
	- Highscore files got broken on reinstalling? Mine did. This is
	  hopefully fixed now.

	Changes:
	- French translation
	- Restructuring of the program package. doc/man/, po/, etc.
	- Added German manpage.
	- Complete rewrite of AI (should be much better now).
	- Source code cleanup.

1.0.4
	Changes:
	- Added German translation.

	Bugfixes:
	- The screen is now cleared correctly if you restart a new game.
	  Sometimes remnants of snow have been left on the screen.

1.0.3
	Changes:
	- Maximum player name length now 21 characters. That broke some
	  scorefiles. On installing the game too long playernames in the
	  scorefile will now be truncated.

	Bugfixes:
	- Sample scorefile that comes with the package wasn't corrected
	  for the new highscore system.
	- Rewrote the highscores handling code to fix the buffer overflow
	  bugs and other strange things (reading names with spaces in them
	  lead to problems).

1.0.2
	Changes:
	- The manpage is not installed executable and more.
	- World Highscore system on the tornado webpage where you can
	  submit your scores automatically at the end of each game.
	- Scores are much higher now:
	  final score = final score * % of your house remaining
	- Improved AI aiming

	Bugfixes:
	- Fixed segfault with "--connect" and non existent hostname.

1.0.1
	Changes:
	- "Current Scores" in main menu shows the player names instead
	  "Player 1" and "Player 2".
	- The Makefile is really perverted now. :^)

	Bugfixes:
	- Fix in the Makefile/install section. Now we test if the directories
	  exist before we put something in there.
	- Tiny fixes and changes.

1.0
	Changes:
	- Lightning now flashes the screen. :^)
	- Location of the highscores files changed to /var/games. You may
	  want to copy your old file there.
	- Scoring system has changed. Higher is better now. Hmm, on a
	  second thought you don't want to keep your old scorefile.
	- Snow is now a defensive weapon. See the manpage for details.
	- Changed the way rain, snow, hail fall down.

	Bugfixes:
	- Someone may have noticed strange numbers drawn on the screen
	  when selecting lightning in non-networkplay mode. They're gone.
	- The program does not segfault when no hostname is specified
	  for "--connect". Other than that, the networking code
	  implemented in version 1.0pre4 seems to be working smoothly.
	- The highscores file is not any more overwritten when installing
	  a new version.
	  - Fixed segfault when trying to show highscores or write a new
	highscore when the tornado.highscores file is missing or
	  unreadable.
	- Highscore file wasn't written when you quit the game with 'no'
	  at the end. Stupid bug.
	- Various typos and other tiny things.

	Notes:
	- This version will not work together with 1.0pre4 in network
	  mode.

1.0pre4
	Changes:
	- Network playing implemented. Starting the game with --server will
	  start the game in server mode where you can connect with --connect host.

	Bugfixes:
	- The winning screen was not cleared when you started a new game.
	
	Notes:
	- Network mode is not really tested. I would not recommend running
	  it as root. There may be buffer overflow bugs lurking in the code.

1.0pre3
	Changes:
	- You can now play the game against the computer as well. The AI
	  still needs a bit finetuning but the game should be much more
	  interesting now if you haven't got anybody to play it with.
	- A highscore system has been implemented.

	Notes:
	- Looks like everything is implemented now and the game is ready
	  for the 1.0 release. Only little things here and there need
	  changes I think. Network play will be done later.
	- If you have more suggestions let me hear them. :-)

1.0pre2
	The code should be well commented now (well mostly). If you use
	jed you can fold and unfold all functions in draw.c now. This was
	the first version announced on freshmeat.

	Changes:
	- The program now clears the screen on exit.

	Bugfixes:
	- draw.c: The function draw_dialog() now uses getnstr to get the
	  user input. You can type names with a max length of 23
	  characters now.

	Notes:
	- The function getnstr() seems not to be implemented in earlier
	  versions of libncurses. I have version 5.0 installed but it does
	  not compile on FreeBSD 3.1 with libncurses 3.0 installed. If you
	  get "undefined reference to 'getnstr'" during compiling you'll
	  have to upgrade to 5.0.

1.0pre1
	All bugs I have noticed so far were fixed. This is the first
	version released into the wild.
	If you look at the source code, it's still kinda uncommented. I'd
	like to change that in one of the next versions.

0.9
	Big version number jump. I don't like version numbers like 0.0.1
	or 0.1234.a12 so I chose that 1.0 would be the first release
	version of the program.
	0.9 was already playable however an unnoticed buffer overflow bug
	prevented you from playing another game after you destroyed your
	opponents house.

0 - 0.9
	No public releases.
