.TH TORNADO 6 "31 January 2002" Games "Tornado VERSION"
.SH NAME
.B tornado
\- clone of the original C64 game.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tornado [--connect IP|--demo|--help|--server|--version]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The object of the game
.B tornado
is to destroy your opponents house with the powers of rain, snow, hail,
lightning and the tornado. 
.P
After the game is started the two player enter their names. If you leave the
field blank the computer will take the player's part. You can see
two houses with each player name in the corner below it and a cloud on
top of the screen, the sky. The player whose turn it is has an asterisk
.I *
next to his name.
.P
From the menu in the center of the screen each
player now picks a weather phenomenon. A second box will appear where
you can enter the aim you would like to use. You may have noticed the
value
.I Windspeed
in the mid bottom of the screen by now. Ideally
you would take aim
.I 2
if windspeed is
.I -2
for example and then
your rain/hail/snow/tornado would go straight down the cloud. However,
it's chosen randomly if the rain appears on the left side of the cloud
or the right side, so aiming might be not that easy as it looks like.
.P
If you hit your opponent's house (or your own) the percentage
counter will decrease depending on how much damage you did. If the
counter is down to
.I 0%
the player loses the game.
.P
The keys you can use in the game are:
.TP
.B s " selects snow"
Snow is a defensive weapon. If you hit a house with snow it creates a coating
that hail cannot destroy. Only rain can be used to destroy that layer of snow.
Lightning and tornado are not effected.
.TP
.B r " selects rain"
Destroys one row of the house. Can be used to melt a row of snow.
.TP
.B h " selects hail"
This will destroy two rows of the house, but cannot destroy a snow coating.
.TP
.B l " selects lightning"
Splits the house into two pieces. Not influenced by wind.
.TP
.B t " selects tornado"
Not as effective as lightning but the tornado goes straight to the bottom
of the house as well.
.TP
.B q " quits the game"
.TP
.B o " show the highscores"
.TP
.B c " show current player scores"

.SH NOTES
When you run the game in network mode you should have the same game versions
on client and server side. Versions prior 1.0pre4 won't work at all due to
the lack of network capability. The game will start with different versions,
but it will probably crash at any time, if there are too many differences
in the two versions.
.P
The Tornado game server runs on port 3000 TCP. (defined in main.c)
.SH BUGS
Destroying your own house will increase your score as well. :^)
